# Andrew Huberman Routine

## Morning Routine

1. Wake by 6/6:30am (go to sleep by 10:30pm +/-30 min)
2. Sunlight in eyes for 10 min - best thing for sleep, mood, metabolism (10 min of natural, bright, outdoor sunlight. 30 min if cloudy. contacts/prescription glasses are fine, but not sunglasses) - maybe get a walk or sit in yard with coffee
3. Hydrate (water + LMNT/sea salt/pink salt)
4. (try) No email, social media, but instead critical task (1 physical + 1 cognitive difficult tasks) OR walk/talk about challenging things for this 1 hour/90 min before caffeine
5. Caffeine - Yerba Mate (90 min after waking - because adenosine receptors are not active & will cause afternoon crash if you drink upon waking)
6. Weight train 45 min - 1 hour (every OTHER day + flexible based on travel) basic, boring, simple workouts VS Cardio on OFF days (jogging, skip rope, swim, run, weight vest run, backwards hill walk, hill walk bands in sunlight) - phone always off or out for MOST workouts
