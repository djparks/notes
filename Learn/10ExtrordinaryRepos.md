GitHub  is the number one platform for sharing all kinds of technologies,  frameworks, libraries, and collections of all sorts. But with the sheer  mass also comes the problem to find the most useful repositories. So I  have decided to curate this list of ten fantastic repositories that  provide great value for all software engineers. All of them have a lot  of GitHub stars, underlining their relevance, popularity, and  usefulness.
Some  of them will help you learn new things, some will help you build cool  things, and all of them will help you to become better software  engineers.

1. Build Your Own X
GitHub stars: 61,300
This fantastic repository  basically is a collection of tutorials on how to build your own  technology. There are examples of how to build a command-line tool, an  operating system, a search engine, a 3D renderer, and many, many more.
Have  you ever wanted to create your own programming language? Or your very  own Docker or Git? Then this is the right repository for you.
2. Free Programming Books
GitHub stars: 139,000
Even though the name of this repository is Free Programming Books,  it offers much more than that. It is available in many different  languages and contains sections for free online courses, interactive  programming resources, problem sets and competitive programming, and  podcasts and programming playgrounds.
But the majority deals with programming books. And that really is an awesome collection.
3. Oh My Zsh
GitHub stars: 106,000
Oh My Zsh  is a community-driven and open-source framework for managing Zsh  configurations. Zsh is both an interactive shell and a powerful  scripting language that many developers use.
Oh  My Zsh comes with powerful plugins and beautiful themes to customize  your Zsh setup. It is a bit of work to get it up and running, but there  are great tutorials on the web and examples of other developers that  will help you find the right settings for you.
4. Coding Interview University
GitHub stars: 104,000
This repository  is a multi-month study plan to become a software engineer for a large  company like Amazon, Google, or Facebook. It is meant for people who are  new to software engineering (where CS knowledge is needed) and also  offers advice on how to study to become a reliability engineer or  operations engineer.
The  author originally created this repo as a personal to-do list to keep  track of his learning process. After studying eight to 12 hours a day  for several months, he finally got his dream job at Amazon as a software  development engineer.
Coding  Interview University will help you prepare for technical interviews at  companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or similar. Make the best  out of it.
5. Gitignore: A Collection of .gitignore Templates
GitHub stars: 97,100
This repository is exactly what the name suggests: a collection of useful .gitignore templates. For every new project you set up as a GitHub repository, it becomes mandatory to have a .gitignore  file to filter what gets uploaded. The content of this file varies from  project to project and language to language. The repo contains  templates for almost any language or framework such as Rails, Python,  Perl, Laravel, Java and many more. There even is a template for Fortran!
6. System Design Primer
GitHub stars: 86,200
This is a great repository for software engineers  that will help you learn how to design large-scale systems. That will  then help you become a better engineer. The repo provides an organized  collection of resources for this broad topic.
Because  system design often is a required component of the technical interview  process at many companies, this repository can also help you to prepare  for those interviews with a study guide, advice on how to approach an  interview, interview questions with solutions, Anki flashcard sets for  interactive learning, and interactive coding challenges.
7. Public APIs
GitHub stars: 73,100
Public APIs  is a great list of free APIs that you can use for your projects and  applications. It covers various topics such as business, anime, animals,  news, finance, games, and more.
There are APIs like cats or dogs APIs that give you pictures of…cats or dogs.
But there are also more useful ones like the Gmail API or the Google Analytics API.
This is really an extensive collection, so go check it out for yourself.
8. The Art of Command Line
GitHub stars: 70,100
Knowing  how to work with the command line is often neglected by developers, yet  it helps to improve productivity and flexibility as an engineer. This repository  contains useful notes and tips on using the command line when working  on Linux. There are sections specifically for Windows or macOS, and in  general tips, are applicable to other UNIX-based OSs. It is both for  beginners and the more experienced.
While  the repository seems to not be maintained actively any longer, it still  provides very good tips that can help you work with the command line.  And you can always fork the repo and maintain it yourself.
9. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
GitHub stars: 64,700
This repository  contains examples of many popular algorithms and data structures for  JavaScript. Each example is either marked as beginner or advanced to  indicate the difficulty. There are examples for hash table, heap, queue,  stack, math, strings, sets, and many more.
10. Developer Roadmap
GitHub stars: 98,600
The last repository  contains a set of charts demonstrating different paths to take and  technologies to adopt in order to become a front-end, back-end, or  dev-ops engineer in 2020. While it seems a bit overwhelming in the  beginning, it is a useful guide for what’s possible and needed in this  fast-changing industry.
