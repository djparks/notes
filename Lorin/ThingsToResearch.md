      3. Quote: "Conclusion: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection."
   6. Pubmed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33944744/> Cloth masks probably increase respiratory illnesses
      1. Quote, "Results: We screened 821 records and assessed nine full-text articles for eligibility. One and seven RCTs were included for cloth and medical mask reviews, respectively. No SARS-CoV-2-specific RCTs and no cloth mask RCTs in community settings were identified. **A single hospital-based RCT provided indirect evidence that, compared with medical masks, cloth masks probably increase clinical respiratory illnesses** (relative risk (RR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 - 2.49) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infections (RR 1.54; 95% CI 0.88 - 2.70). Evidence for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) was uncertain (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.69 - 100.03). Two RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may make little to no difference to ILI infection risk versus no masks (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.81 - 1.19) in the community setting. Five RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may slightly reduce infection risk v. no masks (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.55 - 1.20) in the household setting."

      3. Quote: Conclusions and Relevance MMWR publications pertaining to masks drew positive conclusions about mask effectiveness over 75% of the time despite only 30% testing masks and <15% having statistically significant results. No studies were randomized, yet over half drew causal conclusions. The level of evidence generated was low and the conclusions drawn were most often unsupported by the data. Our findings raise concern about the reliability of the journal for informing health policy.
      4. <https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/cdc-used-journal-to-promote-face-masks-despite-unreliable-and-unsupported-data-new-analysis_5396186.html> Quote from Article, A new analysis of studies in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) flagship scientific journal found the agency promoted the effectiveness of masks using unreliable data with conclusions unsupported by evidence.

The preprint, published July 11 on MedRxiv, found the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) made positive findings about the efficacy of masks 75 percent of the time, despite only 30 percent of studies testing masks, and less than 15 percent having “statistically significant results.”

No studies were randomized, yet the CDC in over half of their MMWR studies, made misleading statements indicating a causal relationship between mask-wearing and a decrease in COVID-19 cases or transmission, despite failing to show evidence of mask effectiveness.

The inappropriate use of causal language in MMWR studies was directly adopted by then CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky to promote masks and recommendations urging Americans to mask up. The authors said their findings “raise concern about the reliability of the journal for informing health policy” and suggest bias within the journal.
   8. Masks offer 'small' benefit against COVID, increased CO2 may be tied to stillbirths: research CO2 concentration after 5 minutes jumps higher than U.S. Navy "exposure limits for submarines carrying a female crew," German researchers find. 12-hour D.C. bar exam may dump mask rule after memo leak. <https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/masks-offer-small-benefit-against-covid-increased-co2-may-be-related>
      1. Quote: "The findings are in line with an Italian mask study published in Environmental Health Insights last fall that found 5 minutes of CO2 buildup "approached the highest acceptable exposure threshold recommended for workers" under U.S. and European labor law, and "concerningly high concentrations" in minors and "virtually" everyone wearing high-quality respirators."
      2. Quote: ""US Navy toxicity experts set the exposure limits for submarines carrying a female crew to 0.8% CO2 based on animal studies which indicated an increased risk for stillbirths," the German researchers wrote, while mammals "chronically exposed" to 0.3% CO2 show "irreversible neuron damage in the offspring, reduced spatial learning" and "reduced circulating levels of the insulin-like growth factor-1." "
      3. Quote: "Circumstantial evidence exists that extended mask use may be related to current observations of stillbirths and to reduced verbal motor and overall cognitive performance in children born during the pandemic."
      4. Quote:"The Oregon Health and Science University researchers reviewed three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 observational studies. Reductions were "nonstatistically significant" in a Danish RCT and Canadian case-control study and statistically significant in a small Brazil study."
      5. Quote: "A much longer ongoing review of mask effectiveness against viral transmission, both COVID and influenza, found masks "probably make little to no difference" based on RCTs, the most rigorous form of scientific evidence."

      2. "Dr. Robert Malone, who helped invent the messenger RNA technology utilized by the vaccine companies in their vaccines, said that the negative effectiveness is consistent with prior data such as a study from the Cleveland Clinic that found each successive vaccine dose increased the risk of infection."
      3. "Other papers have also estimated that protection against infection turns negative over time. Some datasets have indicated that vaccinated people were at higher risk of hospitalization, long seen as a surrogate for severe disease."
      4. "Researchers in one recent paper said that repeated vaccination—some Americans have received a half-dozen COVID-19 shots in under three years—weakens immune systems, potentially making people susceptible to life-threatening conditions such as cancer."

All people who reported testing positive for COVID-19 said they had received at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. While about 4,462 people attended the conference in Berlin in the fall of 2022, just 1,355 filled out a survey and only about half of those were tested after the conference, researchers said in the new paper, published on June 13 by JAMA Network Open, a journal from the American Medical Association."

      1. Quotes "The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several other top officials knew in early 2021 that vaccinated people were becoming infected with COVID-19, according to an email obtained by The Epoch Times.  CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told colleagues in the Jan. 30, 2021, missive that she had spoken with Dr. Francis Collins that morning “and one of the issues we discussed was that of vaccine breakthroughs.”"
      2. Quote: "A few months after the email, Walensky went on MSNBC and claimed that data from the CDC and clinical trials “suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus” and “don’t get sick.”"
      3. There were also severe cases in the trials among the vaccinated, including some not counted by Pfizer.

   5. Great Barrington Declaration <https://gbdeclaration.org/>
      1. "On October 4, 2020, this declaration was authored and signed in Great Barrington, United States, by:"
         1. Dr. Martin Kulldorff, professor of medicine at Harvard University, Dr. Sunetra Gupta, professor at Oxford University, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, professor at Stanford University Medical School
      2. Quote: "As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all – including the vulnerable – falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity – i.e.  the point at which the rate of new infections is stable – and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity."
      3. "Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza."
      4. "The Great Barrington Declaration – As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection.
      5. "Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice."

   6. "Very large Cleveland Clinic study shows more vaccines make you more likely to get COVID" <https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.17.22283625v1.full.pdf>
      1. "Executive Summary, Study done at the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, rated #2 best hospital in the world by Newsweek, shows people with more jabs were more likely to get COVID than people with fewer jabs. In other words, we now know that the vaccines had the opposite effect from what we were told."
      2. Newsweek #2 Reference: <https://www.newsweek.com/rankings/worlds-best-hospitals-2023>
      3. "Background. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine protects
against COVID-19. The multivariable analyses also found that, the more recent the last prior COVID-19 episode was the lower the risk of COVID-19, and that the **greater the number of vaccine doses previously received the
higher the risk of COVID-19.**"
      1. There is no room for ambiguity on the dose vs. infection rate. The paper also cited two other large studies which found the same thing: that more vaccines can increase the likelihood of infection. For example, the Qatar paper found a 47% increased likelihood of infection if you had 3 doses compared to 2 doses. The other paper found a 54% higher infection rate for those who got 2 doses vs. 1 dose. See a pattern?
      2. FDA, "The FDA asked Pfizer to do a post hoc analysis from July 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021 (first two months of Delta). here is the top of page 22:" "<https://www.fda.gov/media/152176/download>
         1. <https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/very-large-cleveland-clinic-study>
         2. "Although not independently verified by FDA, the post hoc analysis appears to indicate that the
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 during the analysis period among 18,727 study participants originally
randomized to BNT162b2 (mean of 9.8 months post-Dose 2 at the beginning of the analysis
period) was 70.3 cases per 1,000 person-years, compared with an incidence of 51.6 cases per
1,000 person-years among 17,748 study participants originally randomized to placebo and
crossed over to BNT162b2 (mean of 4.7 months post-Dose 2 at the beginning of the analysis
period). An additional analysis appears to indicate that incidence of COVID-19 generally
increased in each group of study participants with increasing time post-Dose 2 at the start of the
analysis period. Only 3 severe COVID-19 cases were reported during the analysis period, all of
which occurred among study participants originally randomized to BNT162b2.
   I’ll summarize for you the rates of COVID infections per 1,000 person years for the fully vaccinated:
      1. 12.6 during the original trial (alpha variant)
      2. 43.4 for people recently vaccinated right before the post hoc analysis started (< 4 months before the analysis)
      3. 51.6 for people vaxxed mean of 4.7 months before the analysis
      4. 70.3 for those vaxxed a mean of 9.8 months before the analysis
      5. In other words, the vaccine protection “wore off” over time. Or, if you believe it never protected you at all and instead degraded your immune response, then it means that after around 5 months, two shots made you 1.6X more likely to get COVID which seems to be more consistent with what was found in this study.  The Cleveland Clinic study suggests that the latter interpretation may be more accurate.

   1. "Attempts to debunk the study: No one has been able to debunk this study with evidence."

> For example, the attempt by McGill to discredit the study is to claim without any evidence that there must be some other factor that explains the consistent results in the study, the 2 other studies, and the Pfizer Phase 3 study. This is known as “the hand-waving argument.” For example, there are 17,000 excess deaths for the COVID vaccine in VAERS. The hand-waving argument is “oh, that’s just because people are more aware of VAERS today and are reporting at 50X more frequently than before.”

      1. Quote: Mechanistically, we confirmed that extended vaccination with RBD boosters overturned the protective immune memories by promoting adaptive immune tolerance. Our findings demonstrate potential risks with the continuous use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters, providing immediate implications for the global COVID-19 vaccination enhancement strategies.

```TEXT
Ten studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask in the community studies only, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness/COVID-like illness (9 studies; 276,917 people); and probably makes little or no difference in how many people have flu/COVID confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 13,919 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported; discomfort was mentioned.

N95/P2 respirators

Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people), or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well-reported; discomfort was mentioned.

Hand hygiene

Following a hand hygiene programme may reduce the number of people who catch a respiratory or flu-like illness, or have confirmed flu, compared with people not following such a programme (19 studies; 71,210 people), although this effect was not confirmed as statistically significant reduction when ILI and laboratory-confirmed ILI were analysed separately. Few studies measured unwanted effects; skin irritation in people using hand sanitiser was mentioned.

   7. WIRED <https://www.wired.com/story/the-face-mask-debate-reveals-a-scientific-double-standard/>
      1. Quote, "THE RECENT BACK-AND-FORTH debate—and policy reversal—over the use of face masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19 reveals a glaring double standard. For some reason, we’ve been treating this one particular matter of public health differently. We don’t see op-eds that ask whether people really need to keep 6 feet away from each other on the street, as opposed to 3 feet, or that cast doubt on whether it’s such a good idea to promote bouts of handwashing that are 20 seconds long. But when it comes to covering our faces, a scholarly hyper-rigor has been applied. In recent weeks, experts have counseled caution—or rejected the use of masks by the general public outright—as they pleaded for better, more decisive evidence."

         1. Quote: "Another data point that catches attention, though, is that the mask-wearing did virtually nothing for anyone under 50 years old."
         2. "But while the results were statistically significant, they were fairly limited. The study found just a 0.7% absolute decrease in COVID-19 symptoms in the cloth mask villages, and a 1.1% absolute decrease in the surgical mask villages."
         3. "Another factor is that increased mask-wearing wasn’t the only change that occurred. The study found that the intervention villages increased social distancing, despite the researchers making no efforts to encourage social distancing in the population. The increase in social distancing was higher in the villages that got surgical masks compared to cloth masks, which were coincidentally the same villages that saw better results."
         4. "Critics of the study also pointed out that, based on the 95% confidence intervals reported, it’s possible the cloth masks had zero effect."

   1. Quotes: "In a peer-reviewed letter published June 16 in the journal Vaccine, a team of experts revealed “major shortcomings” with the FDA’s near real-time surveillance study assessing outcomes in U.S. COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Dr. Joseph Fraiman, an emergency room physician associated with the Baromedical Research Institute in New Orleans, and his co-authors raise serious concerns about whether the surveillance system is fit for its purpose and how the FDA performed its analysis. “The FDA has repeatedly stated that it is conducting intensive, historically unprecedented monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine safety and that the only serious harms associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are anaphylaxis, myocarditis, and pericarditis,” the researchers said in an email to The Epoch Times. “However, in our letter, we detail why the U.S. government’s safety surveillance system is woefully inadequate and, as a result, potentially missing safety signals.”"

4. The Schwab study proves the COVID vaccines are killing massive numbers of people <https://kirschsubstack.com/p/the-schwab-study-proves-the-covid>
   1. Quote: "I’ve written about the Schwab paper before, but I wanted to put it all in an article to make it easy to reference. Basically, this study, written by top German scientists and published in a prestigious German peer-reviewed medical journal, proves that the COVID vaccines kill people. They basically started with 35 bodies who died within 20 days of a COVID shot, and focused on 5 where no other cause of death could be ascribed. All 5 had similar findings consistent with a vaccine injury and inconsistent with any other known cause of death.  This suggests that at least 5/35 or 14% of people who die within 20 days of vaccination were likely killed by the vaccine. Note that is a lower bound. Despite having world-famous pathologist Peter Schirmacher as the senior author on the paper, the Schwab paper will never be covered in the mainstream media anywhere in the world. It was published Nov 22, 2022 and ignored by the media. Having more than 14% of the deaths 20 days after vaccination being caused by the vaccine should be an immediate stopping condition in any sane world. But medicine today is dictated by politics, not science."

   1. Quote: "Drawing on “comparative analysis of genomic data,” the paper’s authors wrote that “our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated construct.” Toward the end of the paper, they added, “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible"
   2. Quote: "Unredacted records obtained by The Nation and The Intercept offer detailed insights into those confidential deliberations. The documents show that in the early days of the pandemic, Fauci and Collins took part in a series of email exchanges and telephone calls in which several leading virologists expressed concern that SARS-CoV-2 looked potentially “engineered.” The participants also contemplated the possibility that laboratory activities had inadvertently led to the creation and release of the virus. The conversations convey a sense of anxious urgency and included speculation about the specific types of laboratory techniques that might have caused the virus’s emergence. After roughly a week of debate and data collection, one of the key figures involved in the deliberations characterized the focus of the group’s work as follows: “to disprove any type of lab theory.” Several of the scientists on the calls and emails then went on to write and publish “Proximal Origin.” It became one of the best-read papers in the history of science."
   3. "“The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered,” Andersen wrote in the email. “I should mention,” he added, “that after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory. But we have to look at this much more closely and there are still further analyses to be done, so those opinions could still change.”"

   2. VAERS data: Downloaded 5/14/2023 <https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html>
   3. "Established in 1990, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (possible side effects) after a person has received a vaccination. Anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS. Healthcare professionals are required to report certain adverse events and vaccine manufacturers are required to report all adverse events that come to their attention."
10. Over-Counting Covid Deaths
    1.  A Positive Covid Milestone <https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/briefing/covid.html> A Positive Covid Milestone - The New York Times.pdf
        1.  Quote: "With vs. from" Covid’s toll, to be clear, has not fallen to zero. The C.D.C.’s main Covid webpage estimates that about 80 people per day have been dying from the virus in recent weeks, which is equal to about 1 percent of overall daily deaths. **The official number is probably an exaggeration because it includes some people who had virus when they died even though it was not the underlying cause of death. Other C.D.C. data suggests that almost one-third of official recent Covid deaths have fallen into this category. A study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases came to similar conclusions.**

        1.  Quote: "Results: Among vaccinated VA patients who died within 30 days after a positive test in January-February, 2022, death was COVID-19-related in 103/150 (69%) of cases (55% causal, 14% contributory). In June-August, 2022, death was COVID-19-related in 70/150 (47%) of cases (22% causal, 25% contributory). Similar results were seen among the 71 patients who died at TMC. A model including hypoxemia, remdesivir, and anti-inflammatory drugs had PPV 0.82-0.95 and NPV 0.64-0.83."

12. Lying Lorin
   1. Ensign Peak Fund isn't taxed. Lied about saying it was. Extremist and Conspiracy theorist. Specific mistruths: Presidency didn't know, Just a mistake filling out forms, Reducing Tax, not Shell corporations, didn't know it was wrong (bad advice from Lawyers)
   2. Lorin said Church leadership didn't know.  SEC explicitly said they did.
      1. That's the reason Church was fined separately.
      2. From charging document, "As referenced in this Order, “senior leadership of the Church” consists of the Church’s First Presidency and Presiding Bishopric."
   3. SEC explicit called them "Shell" Corporations
      1. <https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-35>
      2. Quote: "The SEC’s order finds that, from 1997 through 2019, Ensign Peak failed to file Forms 13F, the forms on which investment managers are required to disclose the value of certain securities they manage. According to the order, **the Church was concerned that disclosure of its portfolio, which by 2018 grew to approximately $32 billion, would lead to negative consequences.** To obscure the amount of the Church’s portfolio, and with the **Church’s knowledge and approval**, Ensign Peak created thirteen shell LLCs, ostensibly with locations throughout the U.S., and filed Forms 13F in the names of these LLCs rather than in Ensign Peak’s name. **The order finds that Ensign Peak maintained investment discretion over all relevant securities, that it controlled the shell companies, and that it directed nominee “business managers,” most of whom were employed by the Church, to sign the Commission filings.** **The shell LLCs’ Forms 13F misstated, among other things, that the LLCs had sole investment and voting discretion over the securities. In reality, the SEC’s order finds, Ensign Peak retained control over all investment and voting decisions.**"
   4. (Just a form error?) SEC Charges Document
      1. "By at least 1998, senior management at Ensign Peak was aware of Ensign Peak’s requirement to file Forms 13F and communicated this requirement to senior leadership of the Church." And they didn't file them.

      4. Quotes WSJ: "Latter-day Saint officials kept the size of the church’s $100 billion investment reserves secret for fear that public knowledge of the fund’s wealth might discourage members from paying tithing, according to the top executive who oversees the account.
      5. "For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, tithing — donating 10% of one’s income to the faith — “is more of a sense of commitment than it is the church needing the money,” **Roger Clarke, head of Ensign Peak Advisors**, which manages the denomination’s investing holdings, told The Wall Street Journal. “So they never wanted to be in a position where people felt like, you know, they shouldn’t make a contribution,” Clarke said."

       1.  Quote: Former Mormon bishop Dr Simon Southerton, who made the initial complaint about the church’s tax practices to the charities’ regulator, said the shift in Australia was important. The investigation by this masthead in April 2022 found some of its tax activities could be in breach of Australian tax laws. Now the Latter-day Saints church, which has repeatedly said it complies with tax laws, has moved to unwind the tax structure. In Australia, the church has ensured that donations and tithing – neither of which are tax-deductible – are routed through a charitable trust to gain 100 per cent tax deductibility. Mormons are required to pay 10 per cent of their gross income in an income-deducting practice known as tithing, a significant financial impost on followers. Australia is unusual among English-speaking countries in that it does not allow tax deductions for tithing or church donations. But it does allow generous deductibility for charitable giving. The use of the Sydney-based LDS Charities Australia – which has no paid staff – ramped up in recent years. The shell company received $90 million in donations in 2021. That fell to just $30 million in 2022. It was in April that year that the charity first came under scrutiny for its tax practices.

      1. Quote, "That’s roughly 75 years and four months faster than the FDA said it could take to complete a Freedom of Information Act request by a group of doctors and scientists seeking an estimated 450,000 pages of material about the vaccine."
      2. Quote, "Rather than producing 500 pages a month — the FDA's proposed timeline — he (the judbe) ordered the agency to turn over 55,000 a month. That means all the Pfizer vaccine data should be public by the end of the summer rather than, say, the year 2097."
   2. Bloomberg - <https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/why-a-judge-ordered-fda-to-release-covid-19-vaccine-data-pronto>
      1. Quotes: "A group of scientists and medical researchers sued the FDA under FOIA to force release of hundreds of thousands of documents related to licensing of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine."
      2. Quote: "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Food and Drug Administration asked a federal judge for permission to make the public wait until the year 2096 to disclose all of the data it relied upon to license Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. That is not a typo. The FDA wanted court approval to have up to 75 years to publicly disclose this information."
      3. Quote: "The agency originally estimated it would need to produce 329,000 pages, and asked the court for permission to produce just 500 pages per month, which would have taken 55 years. In its final brief to the Court, the FDA admitted that the total page count was at least 451,000, but still sought permission to produce just 500 pages per month."

      1. Said 55 years in earlieer report not 75 in later  -- i.e. went up.
      2. Quote: "Freedom of Information Act requests are rarely speedy, but when a group of scientists asked the federal government to share the data it relied upon in licensing Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, the response went beyond typical bureaucratic foot-dragging.
      3. Qote: "As in 55 years beyond."
   4. SNOPES: Labeled as "misleading"
      1. Snopes quote, "In Summary: A scheduling dispute related to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for more than than 329,000 pages of COVID-19 vaccine data led to misleading social media posts in November 2021. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a schedule to process and release 500 pages every month, arguing that this is the standard rate to process FOIA requests as "reviewing and redacting records for exempt information is a time-consuming process." The FDA would start releasing this data immediately, but the full set of pages would not be processed until 2076. The FDA argued that the amount of time required to fulfill this request is due to the broad FOIA request that involves hundreds of thousands of pages."
      2. According to Rueters in 2022, "at least 451,000 (pages)".
   5. EPOCH Times article <https://www.theepochtimes.com/judge-orders-fda-to-speed-up-release-of-covid-19-vaccine-trial-data-from-23-5-years-to-just-2_5263217.html>
      1. Quote: "“Democracy dies behind closed doors,” is how U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman opened his order, which requires the FDA to produce the data on Moderna’s and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines at an average rate of at least 180,000 pages per month.  The FDA had argued it would be “impractical” to release the estimated 4.8 million pages at more than between 1,000 and 16,000 pages per month, which would have taken at least 23.5 years."

   1. New Report Reveals CISA Tried to Cover Up Censorship Practices
      1. <https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/new-report-reveals-cisa-tried-cover-censorship-practices>
      2. CISA considered the creation of an anti-misinformation "rapid response team" capable of physically deploying across the United States.
      3. CISA moved its censorship operation to a CISA-funded non-profit after CISA and the Biden Administration were sued in federal court, implicitly admitting that its censorship activities are unconstitutional.
      4. CISA wanted to use the same CISA-funded non-profit as its mouthpiece to "avoid the appearance of government propaganda."
      5. Members of CISA's advisory committee agonized that it was "only a matter of time before someone realizes we exist and starts asking about our work."
      6. In response to mounting public scrutiny, CISA scrubbed its website of references to its domestic surveillance and censorship activities.
